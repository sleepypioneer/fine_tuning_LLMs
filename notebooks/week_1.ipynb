    "Encoder-Decoder architecture.\n",
    "**Ecoder** reads in a sequence of tokens and generates representations for each. It applies multi-headed self-attention to model relationships between all tokens simultaneously. The **Decoder** consumes these to generate output text. By calculating attention weights between tokens, transformers are able to focus on the most relevant parts of the text for an individual token.\n",

    "## Fine Tuning LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLMs are pre-trained on large datasets and then fine-tuned on a specific task.\n",
    "- pre-trained models are initially trained on a general domain dataset using self-supervised learning.\n",
    "- this provides a deep understanding of language structure and meaning.\n",
    "- however, if used as is, the model will not perform well on specific tasks, producing generic outputs, lacking coherence, or even being inappropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Benefits**\n",
    "- cost effective (smaller model can be deployed, don't have to train from scratch)\n",
    "- privacy (don't have to share data with third parties or rely on black box solutions)\n",
